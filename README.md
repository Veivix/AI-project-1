# Freezing of the lake - Building AI course project
Prediction of the lake ice thickness

## Summary
The project collects climate data and performs measurements of ice thickness. 
Once sufficient data has been collected, the program predicts ice thickness based on current yearâ€™s climate data.

## Background
The ice thickness of the lake in question has been estimated for some years by performing rough calculations based on climate data, which have then been compared with rough measurements. The aim of the project is to find out what kind of result AI based prediction will give when more and more accurate data is accumulated. In addition, there is climate change, the impact of which is assessed through annual accumulations.

## Data and AI techniques
One target is to find out correct Neuro Network methods.

## How is it used?
The climate data for the year in question are loaded into the program as income test data same time with training data from previous years. Details of the data to be defined later.

## Challenges
Gathering high-quality data will require several years and a moderate amount of work. 
Project needs to develop suitable ice measuring tools and AI methods. 
The system does not predict ice breaking limit for walking, skiing, ice fishing etc. activities in any lake. In such cases the ice breaking must be ensured by other methods.
